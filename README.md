# Character Diversion
This repository will document a process in designing a platform for typographic discourse.

# Abstract
Latin and Hebrew are scripts that have developed different conventions over the millennia. To enable a coherent reading experience and efficient font production, these script conventions have linked certain characters together at a structural level. Because of script conventions, character groups such as ›h‹, ›n‹, ›m‹ change predictably in different fonts. There are no such character groups containing characters from both Hebrew and Latin script. Defining new cross-script character relationships and exploring how those would affect multi-script typeface design is at the core of this thesis.
The process is divided into three steps: (1) creating a list of potential cross-script character relationships and grouping as well as categorizing these relationships; (2) modifying a set of existing typefaces according to the newly defined relationships and incorporating the modifications into variable OpenType settings of the font to subsequently expose these variabilities to software; (3) visualizing the modifications in dedicated software to present the considerations and create a space for discussion. The software could also serve as a tool for multi-script typeface designers to view potential relationships between character fragments and this way streamline their workflow.

# Research Questions
- How can relationships be established between characters from different scripts without blurring the particularity of the target script?
- How can this process be visually and interactively explained?
